Interested in using this in your own town? 

A smartystreets.com account for geocoding. They're free for non-profits. :) There, you can generate your API key. 

A mapbox account is not required if you just want to use the mapbox.js library. If you wish to use another tile source (any TMS for that matteR), you can, see mapbox docs for info that.
